# HotkeyApi

I'm working on this for a school project and decided to make it public on here to get some practice with GitHub.
It's an API that give different hotkeys for Windows applications and Windows 10 in general.
It contains over 1000 hotkeys!
This is my first public GitHub project, let me know in an issue if there's something I should be doing differently (I think issues are where you would put that?)

I also plan on making a program with a GUI that connects to this API to help display the tips in a more user-friendly way. I'll link that repository here when I make it.

I took the hotkeys from these websites and reformatted a lot of it:
