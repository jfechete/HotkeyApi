# HotkeyApi

I'm working on this for a school project and decided to make it public on here to get some practice with GitHub.
It's an API that give different hotkeys for Windows applications and Windows 10 in general.
I'll add documentation after I finish designing it.
I also plan on making a program with a GUI that connects to this API to help display the tips in a more user-friendly way. I'll link that repository here when I make it.
