# HotkeyApi

I'm working on this for a school project and decided to make it public on here to get some practice with GitHub.
It's an API that give different hotkeys for Windows applications and Windows 10 in general.
It contains over 1000 hotkeys!
This is my first public GitHub project, let me know in an issue if there's something I should be doing differently (I think issues are where you would put that?)

Here's a program I made to go with this that connects to this API and displays a GUI for it: https://github.com/jfechete/Hotkeys.

I took the hotkeys from these websites and reformatted a lot of it:
